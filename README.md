# Car-crossing-game
This is a simple road crossing game with turtle
This code sets up a simple game using the Turtle module in Python. Let's break down the components:

Imports:

time: Used for adding delays.
Screen from turtle: Provides the canvas for drawing.
Player, CarManager, and Scoreboard: Custom classes from respective modules for managing the player, cars, and scoreboard functionalities.
Setting up the screen:

screen = Screen(): Creates a screen object.
screen.setup(width=600, height=600): Sets up the dimensions of the screen.
screen.tracer(0): Turns off animation to manually update the screen.
Creating game elements:

player = Player(): Initializes the player object.
car_manager = CarManager(): Initializes the car manager object responsible for handling cars.
scoreboard = Scoreboard(): Initializes the scoreboard object.
Event handling:

screen.listen(): Listens to keyboard events.
screen.onkey(player.move_up, "Up"): Associates the "Up" arrow key press with the player's move_up method.
screen.onkey(player.move_down, "Down"): Associates the "Down" arrow key press with the player's move_down method.
Game loop:

while game_is_on:: Initiates the game loop, which continues until the variable game_is_on becomes False.
time.sleep(0.1): Adds a small delay to control the game's speed.
screen.update(): Manually updates the screen to reflect changes.
Car management:

car_manager.create_car(): Creates a new car.
car_manager.move_cars(): Moves all existing cars.
Collision detection:

Checks for collision between the player and cars. If a collision is detected, the game ends (game_is_on becomes False), and the scoreboard displays the game over message.
Crossing detection:

Checks if the player successfully crosses to the finish line. If so, the player goes back to the starting position, the car manager advances to the next level, and the scoreboard updates the level.
Exit condition:

screen.exitonclick(): Keeps the screen open until the user clicks on it, allowing the user to close the game window.
Overall, this code sets up a simple game where the player navigates a character avoiding cars moving across the screen, aiming to reach the finish line while increasing their score and level.
